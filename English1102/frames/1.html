        <p>It wasn't until 2002 that Matt Roberts got his first Nintendo 64. </p>
        <p>Growing up as an only child, Matt was generally rather introverted, and his parents had easily convinced him that video </p>
        <p>games weren't a huge priority in his life. </p>

        <p>Despite not having video games, though, Matt managed to keep himself entertained. As a kid, he enjoyed playing simple puzzle </p>
        <p>games of all sorts. Matt played crossword puzzles and mazes and matching games and logic puzzles and more.</p>
        <p>Even when Matt finally got his Nintendo 64, he found that he had an odd addiction to The New Tetris 64, a game his parents had </p>
        <p>found for sale at the flea market for only $2.</p>

        <p>In elementary school, Matt had a few close friends, but he had trouble connecting with many of the other kids because his </p>
        <p>hobbies were a bit offbeat; not too many of his classmates enjoyed blazing through puzzle books the way he did. </p>
        <p>He had mixed feelings about school itself, though. Matt felt that class was often bland. </p>

        <p abbr="0.png">And you see, what's even smaller than a molecule is an atom. The word atom comes from the Greek word for "uncuttable." </p>
        <p abbr="0.png">But even though atoms are supposed to be uncuttable, we have protons, neutrons, and electrons which are even smaller </p>
        <p abbr="0.png">than atoms. Protons have positive charges, electrons have negative charges, and neutrons have neutral charges. </p>
        <p abbr="0.png">When you get to middle school, you'll learn more about why this is significant, but for now, I'll tell you that electrons are </p><p abbr="0.png">very, very small, and protons, while also small, are less small. And if you remember a few weeks ago...</p>

        <p>Honestly, Matt found school pretty boring. </p>

        <p>However, Matt did find some aspects of school really enjoyable. </p>
        <p>In particular, Matt looked forward to every Friday when the class would solve brainteasers. </p>
